The best use case (and the purpose of its existence!) is to allow POST/PUT/DELETE requests in an app to be saved and performed in their correct order at a later time, in case the network connection is unavailable. It uses an NSOperationQueue to automatically handle these operations in separate threads, and makes use of delegate methods to provide the host application “hooks” to serialize and deserialize objects for greater flexibility.\r\n\r\nIts only dependency is [FMDB](https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb).\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nTo run the example project; clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.\r\nThe project consists of a simple table view that allows you to create \"Requests\", which are mock asynchronous operations that have a random amount of latency before they finish.\r\nThere is also a button to make your app go \"online\" and \"offline\". When \"offline\", any new requests added start in a \"Stopped\" state. When you either go \"online\" or restart the application, these Requests are inserted into a queue and then performed one at a time.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nBAPersistentOperationQueue is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), to install\r\nit simply add the following line to your Podfile:\r\n\r\n```\r\npod \"BAPersistentOperationQueue\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n\r\nFull documentation is available through [CocoaDocs](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/BAPersistentOperationQueue), but here are the highlights:\r\n\r\n### The queue\r\n\r\n#### startWorking\r\nStarts processing operations in the queue. If the queue has no operations in memory, it will try to load more from the database.\r\n\r\n#### stopWorking\r\nStops processing operations in the queue.\r\n\r\n#### loadOperationsFromDatabase\r\nLoads operations from the database into the memory queue.\r\n\r\n### The BAPersistentOperationQueue Delegate\r\nThe class where you'll use the queue can (and probably should) conform to this protocol.\r\n\r\n#### persistentOperationQueueSerializeObject:\r\nThis hook gives you the chance to serialize your custom objects into the queue. You should return an ```NSDcitionary``` with arbitrary data that you want to save. This data will later be used to reconstruct your object.\r\n\r\n#### persistentOperationQueueStartedOperation:\r\nThis hook is triggered when an operation begins processing. You are then able to use the operation's ```data``` property to reconstruct your original object. You are also responsible for finishing the operation in this delegate, by calling ```[operation finish]```.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nBAPersistentOperationQueue is available under the MIT license.
